    "## About this notebook\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no prior installation of any programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory. To connect with Colab, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" appears in the address bar. You can right-click on \"Open in Colab\" and select \"Open in new tab\" if the left click does not work for you. Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on GitHub or Colab, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook.\n",

    "## About this demo\n",
    "Each WSI can contain up to million nuclei of various types, which can be further analysed systematically and used for predicting clinical outcomes. In order to use nuclear features for downstream analysis within computational pathology, nucleus segmentation and classification must be carried out as an initial step. However, this remains a challenge because nuclei display a high level of heterogeneity and there is significant inter- and intra-instance variability in the shape, size and chromatin pattern between and within different cell types, disease types or even from one region to another within a single tissue sample. Tumour nuclei, in particular, tend to be present in clusters, which gives rise to many overlapping instances, providing a further challenge for automated segmentation, due to the difficulty of separating neighbouring instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate how you can use the TIAToolbox implementation of [HoVer-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06499.pdf) to tackle these challenges and solve the problem of nuclei instance segmentation and classification within histology images. HoVer-Net is a deep learning approach based on horizontal and vertical distances (and hence the name HoVer-Net) of nuclear pixels to the centre of mass of the corresponding nucleus. These distances are used to separate clustered nuclei. For each segmented instance, the nucleus type is subsequently determined via a dedicated up-sampling branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, we are not going to explain how HoVer-Net works (for more information we refer you to the [HoVer-Net paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841519301045)), but we will show how easily you can use the sophisticated HoVer-Net model, which is incorporated in TIATtoolbox, to do automatic segmentation and classification of nucleus instances. Mostly, we will be working with the [NucleusInstanceSegmentor](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox/blob/master/tiatoolbox/models/engine/nucleus_instance_segmentor.py#L256) which by default uses one of the pretrained  [HoVerNet](link_to_hovernet_dcoumentation) models. We will also cover the [visualisation tool](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/develop/usage.html?#module-tiatoolbox.utils.visualization) embedded in TIAToolbox for overlaying the instance segmentation results on the input image."

    "- `pretrained_model`: specifies the name of the pretrained model included in the TIAToolbox (case sensitive).

You can find a complete list of currently available pretrained models [here](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html?highlight=architecture#module-tiatoolbox.models.architecture). In this example, we use the `\"hovernet_fast-pannuke\"` pretrained model, which is HoVer-Net model trained on the [PanNuke dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10778). Another option for HoVer-Net is `hovernet_original-kumar` which is the original version of the HoVer-Net model trained on a dataset by [Kumar et al.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j3154xgkkpkri9w/IEEE_TMI_NuceliSegmentation.pdf?dl=0)\n",

    "\n",
    "- `num_postproc_workers`: as the name suggests, this parameter controls the number of CPU cores (workers) that are responsible for the \"model related post-processing\" tasks, which consist of horizontal and vertical maps gradient calculations, instance marker generation, and marker-controlled watershed method to generate the final instance map (for more information, please refer to the [HoVer-Net paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841519301045)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `batch_size`: controls the batch size, or the number of input instances to the network in each iteration. If you use a GPU, be careful not to set the `batch_size` larger than the GPU memory limit would allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `inst_segmentor` has been instantiated as the instance segmentation engine with our desired pretrained model, one can call the `predict` method to do inference on a list of input images (or WSIs). The `predict` function automatically processes all the images on the input list and saves the results on the disk. The process usually comprises patch extraction (because the whole tile or WSI won't fit into limited GPU memory), preprocessing, model inference, post-processing and prediction assembly. Here are some important parameters required by the `predict` method properly:\n",

    "- `mode`: the mode of inference which can be set to either `'tile'` or `'wsi'` for plain histology images or structured whole slides images, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `on_gpu`: can be `True` or `False` to dictate running the computations on GPU or CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `crash_on_exception`: If set to `True`, the running loop will crash if there is an error during processing a WSI. Otherwise, the loop will move on to the next image (wsi) for processing. We suggest that you first make sure that the prediction is working as expected by testing it on a couple of inputs and then set this flag to `False` to process large cohorts of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `tile_output`, the `prediction` method returns a list of paths to its inputs and to the processed outputs saved on disk. This can be used later during processing and visualisation.\n",

    "As you can see, `overlay_prediction_contours` beautifully generates an image that has the instance segmentation classification overlaid. Here are the explanations regarding this function's arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `canvas`: the image on which we would like to overlay the predictions. This is the same image as the input to the `predict` method, loaded as a numpy array.\n",
    "- `inst_dict`: predicted instance dictionary. This is the dictionary that we earlier loaded using the `joblib.load()` function. It is the output of HoVer-Net and contains the predicted instances.\n",
    "- `draw_dot`: specifies whether to show detected nucleus centroids on the overlap map. Default is False.\n",
    "- `type_colours`: a dictionary containing the name and colour information for each class in the prediction. The HoVer-Net model in this example predicts 5 classes of cell, and so we created  `color_dict` containing colour information for all types. The `type_colours` dictionary uses the formal `{type_id : (type_name, colour)}` format where `type_id` is from 0 to N (corresponding to classes) and `colour` is a tuple (R, G, B) specifying the colour in RGB format.\n",
    "- `inst_colours`: if you only have the instance segmentation results or do not like to colour instances based on their types, you can set this parameter to assign a colour for all instances or provide a list of colours to assign different colours to different instances in `inst_dict`.\n"

    "### Inference on WSIs\n",
    "The next step is to use TIAToolbox's embedded model for nucleus instance segmentation on a whole slide image. The process is quite similar to what we have done for tiles. We will just introduce  some important parameters that configure the instance segmentor for WSI inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we re-defined the `inst_segmentor` just to show the use of the `auto_generate_mask` parameter. By setting this parameter to `True`, we are telling TIAToolbox to automatically extract the tissue masks of the input WSIs if they are not provided in the `predict` function parameters.\n",
    "In this example, we leave `auto_generate_mask=False` because we are using a WSI that contains only tissue region (there is no background region) and therefore there is no need for tissue mask extraction.\n",
    "> Please note that this part may take too long to process, depending on the system you are using (GPU enabled/disabled) and how large the input WSI is."
